# Typescript Definitions for [Mithril](https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js) 1.0

Requires TypeScript 2.x.

NOTE: Both [Mithril](https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js) 1.0 and these types are subject to change, so use at your own risk.

See `mithril-tests.ts` for examples.

### Trying stuff out

The easiest way to look at what's going on with the types is to install VSCode or some other editor/IDE with good TS language support. Open the `mithril-tests.ts` file and then hover the cursor over variables to inspect types. Try making changes and adding other code that uses the mithril API.

Do an `npm install` if you want to compile the test file. Simply run `tsc` or `npm test`.
