# Typescript Definitions for Mithril 1.0

Note: Mithril 1.0 is currently still in development.

These types should be considered a first pass "sketch" without a lot of testing.

Both Mithril 1.0 and these types are subject to change, so use at your own risk.

They will however allow you to use Mithril 1.0 in a more modular way with Typescript...

    import * as h from 'mithril/hyperscrpt'
	import * as mount from 'mithril/mount'

...rather than importing the entire library attached to the `m` object.

The library being so small to begin with this hardly matters, but it's a thing you can do now.
